The goal of this exercise was to practice using decision trees & ensemble methods when working with a sample CSV file in this case, the Iris Dataset CSV file which compares the petal length and width of three different species.

For context, a decision tree is a form of machine learning that splits into subsets of data. Each leaf or node represents a decision that was made in the process. The splitting process of data or continuation of branches continues until it can no longer be done.
